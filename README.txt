This project has the aim of creating a functional Rock Paper Scissors application for the web. It will be done in two parts:
1. Craeting the script file for the game to run within the console. This project is outlined in The Odin Project's Web Development 1010 at https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css 
2. Create the front end of the website. This part of the project will be accomplished at a sepreate time and is outlined in The Odin Project's HTML/CSS course at ______.

I will also be using this document as a space to plan out the project. 

What do I need?:
    - A hierarchy to show Rock>Scissors, Paper>Rock and Scissors>Paper
    - A computer player and a human player
    - Computer player needs to randomly generate a play (Rock, Paper, or Scissors)
    - Palyer needs to input their play
    - A function to combine the computer and players' choices and align it to the         hierarchy established, (probably and if...else if statement)
